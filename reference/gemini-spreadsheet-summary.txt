Based on Annie's notes, here is a breakdown of the specific tasks and responsibilities she must perform to successfully track and manage housing for the cast and crew.


1. Requirements Gathering & Roster Organization

Organize the Crew: Annie needs to compile a list of everyone needing a room, organized by hierarchy and department.

Identify Special Cases: She must track specific needs in a "notes" column, identifying:

Crew members who can share a room or house.

Crew who do not need a room.

Crew who need a room for dates that differ from the standard shooting schedule.

Crew who are staying through the weekend.


2. Schedule Planning & Buffers

Define the Block: She needs to slot shooting dates by the week (Sunday through Saturday).

Calculate "Real" Dates: She must manually adjust the dates to include necessary buffers:

Add a day on the "front end" for prep and early arrival.

Add an extra day on the "back end" for early morning wraps to allow for "turn around time" (sleep).

Daily Breakdown: She needs to break down the week by day/night to visualize exactly where everyone is at any given moment.


3. Inventory & Assignment

Cross-Reference Inventory: She must work with a separate "master list" that holds the block of rooms the production has actually reserved for the week.

Assign Housing: She needs to designate a specific hotel, room, or house to each crew member under the relevant weekly column.

Record Details: She must ensure the physical address of every Hotel, Motel, BnB, or Airbnb is listed for the crew.


4. Logistics & Movement Management

Track Movements: She must track the "IN" (check-in) and "OUT" (check-out) dates for every single accommodation segment.

Manage Splits: If shooting spans multiple locations (e.g., a "2nd week"), she must track where the crew member is moving to next.

Coordinate Moves: She needs to identify exactly when a crew member has to "move" (check out of one hotel and into another) during the shoot.


5. Vendor Negotiation & Crew Communication

Negotiate Timings: Because crews often work past midnight but face 11:00 AM check-out times, Annie is responsible for "begging and pleading" with hotels for late check-outs or early check-ins.

Coordinate Bag Drops: If a late check-out isn't possible, she arranges for crew to drop their bags at the hotel before heading to set.

Alerting: She is responsible for alerting crew members when they have a check-out coming up so they don't miss it.


=== Crew member Data Points

Based on Annie’s workflow and notes, here are the specific data points she needs to collect from (or verify for) each crew member to populate her tracking system effectively:

1. Identity & Classification
To organize the master list correctly, she needs:


Full Name: To identify the crew member.


Department: To group crew members together (e.g., Camera, Sound, Art).


Hierarchy/Role: To sort the list by rank, likely determining who gets priority for certain rooms or single-occupancy assignments.

2. Housing Preferences & Status
She needs to know their specific living requirements:


Housing Need Status: Does the crew member actually need a room, or do they have their own accommodation?.



Roommate Willingness: Can this person share a room or a house, or do they require a single room?.


Specific Roommates: Who specifically can they share with? (Implied by "crew members that can share a room" ).


3. Schedule Exceptions
While the shooting dates are standard, she needs to capture personal deviations:


Custom Dates: Does the crew member require dates different from the standard shooting schedule?.


Weekend Stays: Will the crew member be staying through the weekend (non-shooting days), or leaving?.



Arrival/Departure Adjustments: Although she calculates buffers, she likely needs to confirm if they need the early arrival day for prep or the late check-out for recovery.


4. Contact Information
To make the "feature request" work:


Mobile Number/Email: She needs a direct contact method to send alerts to the crew member regarding check-out times and moves.
